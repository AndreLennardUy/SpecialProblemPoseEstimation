# Isometric Exercise Pose Detector

This is an Android application that utilizes the MoveNet Lightning library from TensorFlow to detect and grade isometric exercise poses in real-time. 
The app uses the device's camera to capture the user's movements and provides feedback on the correctness of the exercise pose.

## Features

- Real-time pose detection and grading for isometric exercises
- User-friendly interface for selecting exercises and viewing results
- Detailed feedback on correct and incorrect body positions

## Tech Stack

- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language for Android development
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Google's lightweight machine learning library for mobile devices
- **MoveNet Lightning**: TensorFlow's pose estimation model for real-time pose detection
- **Android Architecture Components**: Recommended architecture patterns and libraries for Android development
- **Camera2 API**: Android's camera APIs for capturing video frames

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/AndreLennardUy/SpecialProblemPoseEstimation
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on your Android device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Launch the app on your Android device.
2. Select the isometric exercise you want to perform from the list.
